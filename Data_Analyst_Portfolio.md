# Data_Analyst_Portfolio

Hello, my name is Steven Thompson and I'm Management Information Systems major with a emphasis on data analytics. My Data Analyst Portfolio is a collection of projects, visualizations, and analyses that showcase my skills, expertise, and capabilities to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.


**1. Web Scraping Experience**
Having detailed knowledge of ethically scraping data sets/content from credible sources, taking that data and making valuable insights.

**2. Data Cleaning and Pre Processing** 
Experience cleaning data to make it ready to analyze. My data cleaning involves the process of removing incorrect and duplicate data, managing any holes in the data, and making sure the formatting of data is consistent.
